This is a small collection of programs that imports, modifies, and stores data from an iTunes XML file. Put the XML file into the "XML" folder, then run "xml_prep.py".

After that, run xml_parser. Finally, run the "data.ipynb", and there should be images of some common data relationships you might be interested in (like play count and rating, skip count and song length, etc).
